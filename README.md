# Lab 4

This repository contains the completed Lab 4 assignment for the COSC-2956-F04 Internet Tools course.  
The goal of this lab is to practice JavaScript basics, including variables, functions, closures, DOM manipulation, and user input handling.

## 📁 Contents

- `exercise-1.html` – Displays "Hello, World!" using a variable and alert.
- `exercise-3.html` – Calls a function with two arguments and displays the result.
- `exercise-4.html` – Returns and displays a result from a function.
- `exercise-5.html` – Demonstrates returning a function from another function (closure).
- `exercise-6.html` – Uses a closure to return a function that squares a number.
- `exercise-7.html` – Separates JavaScript into an external file (`js/square.js`) and calls the square function.
- `exercise-8.html` – Takes user input from an input box and displays it.
- `exercise-9.html` – Simple input and output using DOM.
- `exercise-10.html` – Takes user input and displays the square using a closure from an external file (`js/counter.js`).
- `js/counter.js` – Contains a closure function for squaring numbers.
- `temp.html` – Demonstrates variable scope with `let` and `var`.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- HTML5
- JavaScript
- Visual Studio Code (recommended editor)

## 🖼️ Features

- User input handling via input boxes and buttons
- JavaScript functions and closures
- DOM manipulation for dynamic output
- External JavaScript file usage
- Demonstration of variable scopes

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Lab_4.git
   ```
2. Open any HTML file in your browser to view the exercise.
3. For exercises using external JS files (like `exercise-7.html` and `exercise-10.html`), ensure the folder structure is preserved:
   ```
   Lab_4/
     ├── exercise-7.html
     ├── exercise-10.html
     └── js/
         ├── square.js
         └── counter.js
   ```
